<p><strong>Tracking Tools, Advertising and Opt-Out</strong></p>
<p>The following sections provide additional information about how we collect your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>
<p>The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, mobile identifiers, and JavaScript&nbsp;(collectively, &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;)&nbsp;to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Services.&nbsp;We do this to analyze trends, learn about and advertise to our user base, and operate and improve our Services.&nbsp;For example, we use Cookies to tailor the Services or customize advertisements by tracking navigation habits, measuring performance, storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customizing user experiences with the Services and for analytics and fraud prevention.&nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of data&ndash; usually text files &ndash; placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Services.&nbsp;We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).</p>
<p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential Cookies.&nbsp;Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested.&nbsp;For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into the secure areas of our Services.&nbsp;Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.</li>
<li>Functional Cookies.&nbsp;Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services.&nbsp;These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences&nbsp;(for example, your choice of language or region).</li>
<li>Performance/Analytical Cookies.&nbsp;Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services, how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services, mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, and text typed into the Services.&nbsp;Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services&rsquo; content for those who engage with our advertising.&nbsp;For example, Google Inc.&nbsp;(&ldquo;Google&rdquo;)&nbsp;uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services.&nbsp;Google&rsquo;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.&nbsp;You have the option to opt-out of Google&rsquo;s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html"><strong>google.com/privacy_ads.html</strong></a>or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"><strong>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Retargeting/Advertising Cookies.&nbsp;Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.&nbsp;For more information about this, please see the section below titled &ldquo;Information about Interest-Based Advertisements.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Web Beacons.&nbsp;Web Beacons&nbsp;(e.g., clear GIFs or pixel tags)&nbsp;are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Services, the web services of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send.&nbsp;The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using selected publishers&rsquo; web services or opening emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising&nbsp;(discussed further below).</li>
<li>Mobile Device Identifiers.&nbsp;Mobile device identifiers help Hexchange learn more about our users&rsquo; demographics and internet behaviors.&nbsp;Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it.&nbsp;Mobile device identifiers enable collection of Personal Data&nbsp;(such as media access control, address and location, and tracking data, including without limitation IP address, domain server, type of device(s)&nbsp;used to access the Services, web browser(s)&nbsp;used to access the Services, referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services, other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services).</li>
<li>Cross Device Matching.&nbsp;To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information&nbsp;(including demographic, geographic and interest-based data).&nbsp;To supplement this analysis, we may also provide de-identified data to these partners.&nbsp;Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies through your internet browser&rsquo;s settings.&nbsp;Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as&nbsp;(depending on your browser software)&nbsp;allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways.&nbsp;You may also be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device.&nbsp;You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your computer.&nbsp;Although you are not required to accept Hexchange&rsquo;s Cookies, if you block, reject, or delete them, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some of the Services and functionalities may not work.</p>
<p>To explore what Cookie settings are available to you, look in the &ldquo;preferences&rdquo; or &ldquo;options&rdquo; section of your browser&rsquo;s menu.&nbsp;To find out more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"><strong>http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Your browser may offer you a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.&nbsp;Not all browsers offer a Do Not Track option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a Do Not Track signal.&nbsp;Please note that, for these reasons and because of our use of Cookies, our Services, like many website operators, do not support &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; requests sent from a browser at this time.&nbsp;To find out more about &ldquo;Do Not Track,&rdquo; you can visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.com/"><strong>www.allaboutdnt.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:</strong></p>
<p>We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services.&nbsp;These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors&nbsp;(&ldquo;Interest-Based Ads&rdquo;).&nbsp;Information for Interest-Based Ads&nbsp;(including Personal Data)&nbsp;may be provided to us by you, or derived or inferred from the online activity or usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties.&nbsp;Such information may include IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, geographic location and demographic information, such as gender and age range.&nbsp;Such information may be gathered through tracking users&rsquo; activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services.&nbsp;To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including Web Beacons, from an ad network to you through the Services.&nbsp;Web Beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.&nbsp;This information helps Hexchange learn more about our users&rsquo; demographics and internet behaviors.&nbsp;Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.&nbsp;Web Beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
<p>We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance&nbsp;(&ldquo;DAA&rdquo;)&nbsp;Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.&nbsp;Through the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;(&ldquo;NAI&rdquo;), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, ads that are customized based a consumer&rsquo;s online behavior across different websites and properties.&nbsp;To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt-out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA&rsquo;s or NAI&rsquo;s consumer opt-out pages, which are located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><strong>http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</strong></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices"><strong>www.aboutads.info/choices</strong></a>, or install the DAA&rsquo;s AppChoice app&nbsp;(for&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8"><strong>iOS</strong></a>; for&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&amp;hl=en"><strong>Android</strong></a>)&nbsp;on your mobile computing device.&nbsp;When you use these opt-out features, an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; Cookie will be placed on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device indicating that you do not want to receive Interest-Based Ads from NAI or DAA member companies.&nbsp;If you delete Cookies on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device, you may need to opt out again.&nbsp;For information about how to opt out of Interest-Based Ads on mobile devices, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device"><strong>http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device</strong></a>.&nbsp;You will need to opt out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.</p>
<p>Please note that even after opting out of Interest-Based Ads, you may still see Hexchange advertisements that are not interest-based&nbsp;(i.e., not targeted toward you).&nbsp;Also, opting out does not mean that Hexchange is no longer using tracking tools &mdash; Hexchange still may collect information about your use of the Services even after you have opted out of Interest-Based Ads and may still serve advertisements to you via the Services based on information collected via the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Data Security and Retention</strong></p>
<p>The security of your Personal Data is important to us.&nbsp;We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data.&nbsp;We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage.&nbsp;For example, the Services use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer&nbsp;(SSL)&nbsp;technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data.&nbsp;We store and process your information on our servers in the United States and abroad.&nbsp;We maintain what we consider industry standard backup and archival systems.&nbsp;You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account.&nbsp;Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, for example, by making good faith efforts to store Personal Data in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure.&nbsp;We cannot and do not guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.</p>
<p>If at any time during or after our relationship we believe that the security of your Personal Data may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.&nbsp;If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances.&nbsp; If we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail to the most recent e-mail address you have provided us in your account profile.&nbsp;Please keep your e-mail address in your account up to date.&nbsp;You can update that e-mail address anytime in your account profile.&nbsp;If you receive a notice from us, you can print it to retain a copy of it.&nbsp;To receive these notices, you must check your e-mail account using your computer or mobile device and email application software.&nbsp;<strong>You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.&nbsp;If you prefer for us to use the U.S.&nbsp;Postal Service to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at&nbsp;</strong><a href="mailto:Privacy-Notice@zocdoc.com"><strong>Privacy-Notice@Hexchange.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Please include your address when you submit your request.&nbsp;You can make this election any time, and it will apply to notifications we make after a reasonable time thereafter for us to process your request.&nbsp;You may also use this e-mail address to request a print copy, at no charge, of an electronic notice we have sent to you regarding a compromise of your Personal Data.</p>
